# Create teams for sport
An app to create teams for a sport.

I made this for my club who plays floorball. To easy the burden for the one trying to make fair teams each practice.
You hook it up to a database and there you can create players, give them a skill level, gender and if they can run alot.

In the App, you choose who is at practice today, what size the team should be and then it will mix the teams to be as equal as possible.
(Currently supporting 3 - 6 person teams.)

HOW TO SET IT UP:
Your provider have to support, HTML, Vanilla JS and PHP, and have a database.
You go to the config folder, in there is a admin file. Change "CHANGE_ME" to the password you want for your admin module.
In the db.php file you set up your DB credentials.

And you are good to go.

You can find the admin module at /admin/
